OpenSync is a full-featured Open Source email client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP for Android.

Its a fork of Open Source Android Email Client : K9-Mail https://github.com/k9mail/k-9

Forked from K-9 Mail Version 5.300-SNAPSHOT

========

Its licensed under the [Apache License Version 2.0](LICENSE). same as k-9.

Its mine personal attempt to make a Android OpenSource Email App with different Name, Logo & Icon to relate it with email.
Its still Beta from my side as its some basic changes to orginal code of K-9.
Would try to find time to add more into this app.
This is noway to replace orginal K-9 Mail app or compete with them.
